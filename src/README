dumpomatic

dumpomatic allows to define one or more database dump jobs for several SQL
databases (PostgreSQL and MySQL/MariaDB as of yet) and servers. Dumps will be
stored within a directory bearing the name of the current date and will be
compressed using gzip.

Usage:
	dumpomatic.php <file or directory>

dumpomatic's parameter might be a configuration file or a directory containing
several configuration files.
Please note that dumpomatic will use the current date at call time.

Configuration:

dumpomatic expects an ini style configuration file, containing the following,
mandatory parameters:

	host
	user
	password
	driver   use PDO driver name here (pgsql or mysql)
	storage  directory to which dumpomatic should backup

Optional parameters:

	include databases to include, comma separated.
	exclude databases to exclude, comma separated.

Please note that include has precedence over exclude, ie dumpomatic will first
skip every database which is not included and then skip every database which is
excluded.

Process:

Once called, dumpomatic tries to connect to the defined database. It then
fetches a list of available databases, removing any items which are not
included or which are excluded.
It then creates a temporary folder within the storage directory, to which the
selected databases are dumped and gzipped, first as a temporary, then as a final
file.
The temporary file is then renamed to the current date at call time.

If a dump jobs throws an exception, a warning will be issued and the next job
will be run. At the end of each run, dumpomatic will print a list of failed
jobs.
